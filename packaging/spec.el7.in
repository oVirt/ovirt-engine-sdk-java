# This should be a tar file containing the generated source code of the
# SDK, as we can't build and run the generator with the packages
# available in the distribution:
Source0: @TAR_URL@

# This file is used to perform the build using Ant, because the upstream
# project has build dependencies that make it impossible to build it
# with the packages available in the distribution:
Source1: build.xml

# This file is used to transform the upstream 'pom.xml' file into a
# 'pom-nodeps.xml' file that doesn't have the dependencies of the
# code generator, as those aren't available in the distribution:
Source2: transform-pom.xsl
